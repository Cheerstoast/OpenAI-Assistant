## OpenAI-Assistant

A minimalist assistant that answers any question.
It can access the internet and use developed AI to get answers.
Powered by OpenAI. Credits to @ZacharyWitten for the original functions.
Why, yes, this program uses my OpenAI API key, but the key is encrypted and stored outside of the code.
